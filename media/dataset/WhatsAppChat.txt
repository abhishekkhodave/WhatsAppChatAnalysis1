8/18/22, 9:20 PM - Dr. Madhav Raul (S. V. P. M): Good evening everyone,

In continuation to our earlier msg, all the students have received exam communication depending upon their choice of Mode. 

Test schedule:
A. Remote Assessment: planned between Friday, Aug 19, to Monday, Aug 29.
B. In-Center Assessments are planned on 2 days Friday, Aug 19, and Saturday, Aug 27.
 
Details of the same are already been shared with the *applicants directly* on their registered email address by TCS ION.
 
Please take note of the below pointers pertaining to the test process – 
 
Students who have opted for Remote Assessment must mandatorily login **1 hour prior to the test shift time.*
Similarly, all students who would take the In-Center test must report at the test center on or before the Reporting Time mentioned in the Hall Ticket.

While taking the Remote Assessment in case a candidate faces any issue, the *ONLY* way to get it addressed is through the *Live Chat option* on the screen. Pls note, the Live Chat option is available in the home page of the application itself and student can communicate directly with representatives even before logging in. 

All students must be advised against capturing photographs of the test screen even to share with us as this may lead to the system flagging off the candidate as ‘Indulging in Unfair Means’.
 
Requesting you to kindly cascade this information to the registered students.

If you have any further queries, please do connect with us individually.
8/18/22, 9:21 PM - Dr. Madhav Raul (S. V. P. M): Instructions for EXAM👆
8/19/22, 12:59 PM - Dr. Madhav Raul (S. V. P. M): Greetings!

 

We are hosting pre-placement talk for all the registered students. This session will certainly help them in knowing TCS better.

 

Request your help in cascading the same with your students.
